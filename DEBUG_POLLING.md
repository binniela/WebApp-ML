# Polling Loop Fix Applied

## Changes Made:

### 1. Reduced Polling Frequency
- Changed from 2 seconds to 5 seconds
- Added document visibility check (only poll when tab is active)

### 2. Request Deduplication
- Prevent multiple simultaneous requests for same contact
- Added throttling for chat request loading (3-second minimum interval)

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Added rate limiter: max 5 requests per 10 seconds per endpoint
- Prevents API spam from multiple tabs/instances

### 4. Proper Cleanup
- Clear intervals on component unmount
- Reset throttling timers on cleanup

## Expected Result:
- Polling should now be: `GET /chat-requests/incoming` every 5 seconds
- Message loading: `GET /messages/conversation/[id]` only when needed
- No more infinite loops or excessive API calls

## To Monitor:
Watch backend logs - should see much fewer requests now.
If still seeing excessive requests, check for multiple browser tabs open.
